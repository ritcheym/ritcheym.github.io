A side effect of being a junior faculty member is that you get asked for advice a lot, mostly from new hires who, offer letter in hand, realize that dozens of decisions are now weighing on them. The most important decisions, of course, are how you plan to spend your time and resources as a new faculty member: What research projects should you start? What should you teach? Who should you hire? For those questions, you should consult your current or former advisors, or senior colleagues in your new department-- the more experience, the better.

But if you want to know things like, what software do you use to keep your lab organized? Or, how do I set up a lab website? Ask someone who has been there long enough to know what has and hasn’t worked, but not so long that they’ve forgotten what those early days were like.

Here's a set of links and tips that I’ve found myself sharing over time. It's heavily biased by my own preferences and experiences, so take whatever is useful for you, and get others’ opinions too!

**Resources for prioritizing your time effectively**

*   The hardest part of starting a tenure-track faculty job is finding the balance between your intellectual goals (thinking hard about interesting problems, doing independent research and writing) and other academic responsibilities (teaching, service, the practicalities of running a lab). The [National Center for Faculty Development and Diversity](facultydiversity.org) hosts programs geared toward teaching academics how to manage their time and achieve success on the tenure track. Many of their resources are available for free online, and I’ve found it helpful to read through them on my own. There is also a highly-reviewed semester-long **Faculty Success Program**, which is costly but may be covered by your university or start-up funds.
*   One excellent NCFDD tip is to develop a **strategic plan** for each semester. I started doing this a couple of years ago, and it really helps to keep me on track with my goals and also highlights when I do (and do not) have time to work on something new. Here’s the [template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MFJFCbIPwnfqAwbyb7nSs684TwwA5m8KEP0Tk99hwY4/edit?usp=sharing) for mine.
*   Another great NCFDD tip is to set aside time at the beginning of each week (the “[Sunday meeting](https://www.insidehighered.com/advice/2010/09/20/sunday-meeting)”) to develop your **weekly plan** for what you need to do and when you’ll do it. A good time to check in with your strategic plan!
*   I also recommend reading the book [Deep Work](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/) by Cal Newport, which crystallizes the benefits of doing **deep, thoughtful work** and offers strategies for you to protect your thinking time.

**Mentoring**

*   I’ve found it incredibly helpful to have a **lab manual** that documents the expectations that I have for my lab and for myself. You can find mine [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L1DhF3gKZKVGb_MDEmdqvBwm5thWiqyMy8AS_kzJnSM/edit?usp=sharing). Other ones I like: [1](http://jpeelle.net/peellelab_manual.pdf), [2](https://github.com/alylab/labmanual), [3](https://github.com/ContextLab/lab-manual).
*   I also keep a webpage with **information for prospective students** (my example can be found [here](http://www.thememolab.org/pages/gradapps/)). It’s a time-saver for when you start getting inquiry emails, and it also helps to level the playing field by communicating your expectations for a successful application.
*   Here is a comprehensive [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ic6bil2AvrQmPFUcUyxcw_FumofKkUo3VLsU7qG0cTk/edit?ts=5edb8469) on **how to recruit and support scientists from underrepresented groups** - it’s a must-read for anyone in science, but especially timely for those who are starting new labs.
*   At the start of each academic year, it’s helpful to meet with your trainees and go over an **individual development plan** ([examples](https://gradschool.uoregon.edu/professional-development/resources/idp)) for the upcoming year.
*   To stay on top of writing **recommendation letters**, one tip is to keep a running doc for each of your trainees so that you’re not starting from scratch when it comes time to write a letter. Another tip is to have students fill out a form ([example](https://forms.gle/1XmHNY4nFsjeeNi46)) that encourages them to reflect on their interactions with you and share the info you need to write an effective letter.

**Grant-writing and planning**

*   The [NIH Early Career Reviewer Program](https://public.csr.nih.gov/ForReviewers/BecomeAReviewer/ECR) is a great opportunity to learn more about the **grant review process** and what reviewers are really paying attention to. I think my grant scores improved by at least 10 points as a result of participating in this program.
*   If you’re not sure where to send your grant proposals, look to see who is funding your colleagues. You can search online for information about **funded proposals**, including research summaries and which institutes/sections have funded them. For the US: [NIH Reporter](https://reporter.nih.gov/), [NSF Award Search](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/advancedSearch.jsp).

**When to start the job & start teaching**

*   If you plan to defer your start date: At some universities, if you start your job in **January**, you are on the same tenure clock as someone who starts the following July. That’s like an extra 6 months to do what you need to do to get tenure, paid on a faculty salary.
*   If you are offered a **course release** during your first year, consider taking it during the second semester, when your research will be ramping up, instead of the first.

**Teaching**

*   **Procrastinate on your teaching prep.** Teaching prep will take you as long as you allow it. If you can handle the time pressure, leave yourself the minimum time possible to prepare or review lecture slides. If you fall short one week (which is not a big deal!), you know what to adjust next time. This gets easier once you’ve taught the class before.
*   **Use separate accounts for teaching.** I have separate Chrome browser log-ins for work and personal use, and then I also created a separate user account on my laptop for teaching. Reduces my paranoia about awkward notifications or other personal information popping up mid-class.
*   Keep your **exam questions** in a spreadsheet, and then use this [script](https://github.com/ritcheym/generate-exam) to randomize the questions/response options into a nicely formatted word doc. If you use Canvas, you can use this [tool](https://canvas.k-state.edu/info/tools/scantron/faq/build-a-scantron-quiz.html) to upload them into a Canvas quiz.

**Stress and whatever work-life balance means**

*   **Form a network for peer support.** I have a Slack channel with some of my grad school classmates, many of whom are still in academia and running labs. We use the channel to seek advice, complain, and joke around, and I’ve found it incredibly helpful to have this as an outlet and sounding board.
*   Find whatever balance works for you. This is a time that many of us are going through other major life changes: getting married or divorced, having kids, coping with infertility, moving away from family and friends, and so on. I’ve had some serious ups and downs since starting my job five years ago. The silver lining is that it has put my work stress into perspective-- not getting a grant feels like a minor inconvenience by comparison. There will be times that you have to invest more of your mental energy into taking care of yourself and your loved ones, than into taking care of your CV. This is okay. **Find the balance between pushing hard on work when you can, and backing off when you can’t.**

**Tools for an organized lab**

*   **R notebooks, Jupyter notebooks:** I loved using R notebooks when I was a postdoc, and now that my trainees are using them, I love them even more. It makes it easy for me to see what’s going on in the code and refer back to the results, all in one place.
*   **Slack:** Make sure you get the academic discount if you want the paid version.
*   **Google Drive & Google Groups:** I’ve gone all in on using Google Groups & Google Drive. One benefit of using Google Groups to manage lab members is that they automatically gain access to anything that has already been shared with that Google Group, e.g., calendars, shared drives, sites, etc. I have groups for 1) my lab manager and me (for purchases etc), 2) for full-time lab members, and 3) for part-time RAs. Bonus tip: On Google Drive, it is best to store shared lab documents in a “[shared drive](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7212025?hl=en)” so that they are owned by the team, not the individual who created them.
*   **Paperpile, Zotero:** For sharing papers & citing them in Google Docs.
*   **Meeting agendas / project update docs:** I encourage my trainees to keep a doc with all of our meeting notes and project updates. Some send them to me ahead of the meeting; some keep them on their own.
*   **Tracking project details:** I keep a spreadsheet listing all active & archived projects, with info about where the data are stored, which IRB protocol they used, when did data collection take place, when was the project presented, where are the manuscript files, etc. When a project is completed, we also link to a doc that points to the essential files and scripts needed for the final results.

**Lab websites & logos**

*   **Public-facing lab website:** I designed my lab website using a Jekyll template, I host it through GitHub, and I bought the domain through Google Domains. Jekyll generates static sites, and updating the site is as simple as pushing a commit to GitHub (here’s a [how-to](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages)). This approach worked for me because I like designing and maintaining websites. If those things are not true for you, you can make an even nicer website with SquareSpace or Wix, for a price.
*   **Internal website:** [Google Sites](https://sites.google.com/new) works very well for an internal lab website or wiki because it’s very easy to update, it’s searchable, and you can restrict page viewing and editing to your team.
*   **Logos:** I’ve seen some people use [99designs](https://99designs.com/) contests for lab logo designs. Or you can bust out your favorite vector graphics software and get to work.

**Miscellaneous**

*   If you’re hiring a **lab manager**: here’s an [example](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r-fxLXmLGEK8-TQgp0D7xrxI7pgsu3VkVdMXTXAfEE4/edit?usp=sharing) of an ad that I’ve used.
*   Annoyed at scheduling one-off meetings? Use Google Calendar [appointments](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/190998?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en) to let students **self-book meetings** with you. This is especially useful for office hours and one-off student meetings. If you don’t have the appointments option on your GCal account, there are other services that let you do the same thing (e.g. Calendly).
*   For a pick-me-up: Use a special label/tag for **emails that make you happy**-- paper acceptances, thank you notes, etc. Re-read them when you need them.
